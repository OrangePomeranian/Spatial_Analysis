# Spatial Analysis

This project presents a spatial analysis of lung cancer tissue using Scanpy, based on data from the human-lung-cancer-ffpe dataset available at 10x Genomics. It encompasses preprocessing, quality control, normalization, PCA, clustering, identification of cluster marker genes, analysis of spatially variable genes, and functional analysis. The study aims to understand the spatial distribution of gene expression within lung cancer tissues, focusing on identifying functionally significant regions and their associated genes.
